# E-Commerce A/B Testing Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end A/B testing experiment built with Python and Streamlit to evaluate the impact of a new e-commerce webpage design on user conversion rates. It applies hypothesis testing, visual analytics, and is fully deployed using Streamlit Cloud.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Streamlit web app
â”œâ”€â”€ ab_data.csv           # E-commerce A/B testing dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation

## Objective

To determine whether the new version of a website results in a statistically significant increase in conversion rates compared to the old version, using real data and hypothesis testing.

---

## Features

- Dataset Preview with filtering by group (control/treatment)
- Conversion Rate Visualization (Bar Chart & Pie Chart)
- Conversion Trends Over Time (Line Chart)
- Summary Metrics (Users, Conversions, Conversion Rate)
- Statistical Significance Test (Z-test)
- Deployed live using **Streamlit Cloud**

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ab-testing-dashboard.git
   cd ab-testing-dashboard
   ```
2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Future Work

Here are a few ideas to enhance and extend the project in the future:

- Add Bayesian A/B testing for more flexible statistical insights
- Add date range filtering with interactive controls
- Compare multiple variants (A/B/n testing)
- Allow CSV upload for running custom A/B experiments
- Store results in a database for long-term tracking
- Email summaries or report generation
